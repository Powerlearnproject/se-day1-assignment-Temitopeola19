Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the art of using engineering methods and tools to create a software system.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Design: it has to do with the planning.
Development: It has to do with building the system.
Deployment: it has to do with rolling it out to users.
maintenance: This is updating for improvement.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer creates the product, the quality assurance engineer ensures the product meets the standard and the project management coordinate the process of creation.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time factor.
Poor internet services 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompting is the act of giving the right instruction to AI. It important because it helps to get the best results from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Which country is close to the Atlantic ocean? 
Which country is the closest to the Atlantic ocean in North America?
The improved prompt is more effective because it's specific and clear by saying closest and mentioning the part of the world.
